# Step: facts and accounts, one scene

{{spec}}

## Your task

Write the facts that scene {{scene_id}} ({{scene_title}}, ¶{{from}}–¶{{to}}) tells, and the accounts they travel
in. You have the story up to the end of this scene and the data so far; you have not read further.

- Every fact the scene's paragraphs tell, one per thing told, each with its paragraph and the exact words: where
  everyone and everything is and when, who has or wears what, what is done, what is said (a `says` fact, with what
  it `asserts`), what someone believes, knows or intends, conditions, roles, owners, names, the weekday and the hour
  (on `calendar`, `clock`), and how things are arranged (see the format: ways between places, what is fastened to what).
  A long speech that reports events is a telling of an account (the speaker's), whose
  facts are the events; the speech itself is a `says` fact only where the saying matters (a claim that may be
  false, a theory, an accusation).
- Lines: `{"file": "facts", …}`; a new account `{"file": "accounts", "id", "label", "origin", "how", "facts"}`;
  facts added to an account so far `{"file": "account_add", "id", "facts": [...]}`.
- Provenance: what the narrator sees and hears goes in the narrator's own account ({{narrator_account}}); what
  someone tells the narrator goes in that someone's account, with a `tells` fact to the narrator; what reached
  them from someone else goes in the first source's account, carried by a `tells` fact at each step. Never file in
  the narrator's own account a fact the narrator only heard about.
- Leave `truth` out (everything is true by default): the answer key comes at the end of the story. Leave out
  `inferable` facts and the two dates (`given_at`, `inferable_at`): a later step adds them. No `q` or `pick` yet.
- If a fact needs an entity or a time point not listed, add it: `{"file": "entities", …}`, `{"file": "times", …}`.
- A fact so far that this scene corrects: `{"file": "facts", "id", …the fields that change}`.
