You are one step of a pipeline that turns a detective story into structured data for a reading game. You see only
what this message gives you. Use only the text given, read as a first-time reader would read it: if you recognise
the story, do not use what you remember of it, its characters' secrets or its ending. Follow the format exactly.
Put your output in one or more ```jsonl fenced blocks, one JSON object per line; anything outside the blocks is
ignored, so keep remarks short.

# Step: the case header

The story's opening paragraphs are below. Say who narrates the story to the reader.

- A first-person narrator is a character: give them an entity id (short snake case, the surname if they have one:
  `hale`), their name as the page will use it in "Hale's own", and `kind: "first-person"`.
- An impersonal third-person narrator is `{"id": "narrator", "name": "the narrator", "kind": "third-person"}`.
- If the story has several narrators (a part told by another character), list each.

Also give `subtitle`: the page's name beside the title, "<name>'s timeline" for a first-person narrator, else
"the timeline".

Output one line: `{"narrators": [...], "subtitle": "..."}`.

## The story's opening

¶0 I. Silver Blaze

¶1 I am afraid, Watson, that I shall have to go,” said Holmes, as we sat down together to our breakfast one morning.

¶2 “Go! Where to?”

¶3 “To Dartmoor; to King’s Pyland.”

¶4 I was not surprised. Indeed, my only wonder was that he had not already been mixed up in this extraordinary case, which was the one topic of conversation through the length and breadth of England. For a whole day my companion had rambled about the room with his chin upon his chest and his brows knitted, charging and recharging his pipe with the strongest black tobacco, and absolutely deaf to any of my questions or remarks. Fresh editions of every paper had been sent up by our news agent, only to be glanced over and tossed down into a corner. Yet, silent as he was, I knew perfectly well what it was over which he was brooding. There was but one problem before the public which could challenge his powers of analysis, and that was the singular disappearance of the favourite for the Wessex Cup, and the tragic murder of its trainer. When, therefore, he suddenly announced his intention of setting out for the scene of the drama it was only what I had both expected and hoped for.

¶5 “I should be most happy to go down with you if I should not be in the way,” said I.

¶6 “My dear Watson, you would confer a great favour upon me by coming. And I think that your time will not be misspent, for there are points about the case which promise to make it an absolutely unique one. We have, I think, just time to catch our train at Paddington, and I will go further into the matter upon our journey. You would oblige me by bringing with you your very excellent field-glass.”

¶7 And so it happened that an hour or so later I found myself in the corner of a first-class carriage flying along en route for Exeter, while Sherlock Holmes, with his sharp, eager face framed in his ear-flapped travelling-cap, dipped rapidly into the bundle of fresh papers which he had procured at Paddington. We had left Reading far behind us before he thrust the last one of them under the seat, and offered me his cigar-case.

¶8 “We are going well,” said he, looking out the window and glancing at his watch. “Our rate at present is fifty-three and a half miles an hour.”

¶9 “I have not observed the quarter-mile posts,” said I.

¶10 “Nor have I. But the telegraph posts upon this line are sixty yards apart, and the calculation is a simple one. I presume that you have looked into this matter of the murder of John Straker and the disappearance of Silver Blaze?”

¶11 “I have seen what the _Telegraph_ and the _Chronicle_ have to say.”

¶12 “It is one of those cases where the art of the reasoner should be used rather for the sifting of details than for the acquiring of fresh evidence. The tragedy has been so uncommon, so complete and of such personal importance to so many people, that we are suffering from a plethora of surmise, conjecture, and hypothesis. The difficulty is to detach the framework of fact—of absolute undeniable fact—from the embellishments of theorists and reporters. Then, having established ourselves upon this sound basis, it is our duty to see what inferences may be drawn and what are the special points upon which the whole mystery turns. On Tuesday evening I received telegrams from both Colonel Ross, the owner of the horse, and from Inspector Gregory, who is looking after the case, inviting my co-operation.”
